how to correctly setup videos.
in prefab directory take TriggerCamera and put it on the scene: after that, on the inspector section, put in the "Time to stop" section put the duration, in seconds, of the video.
On the Hierarchy section select the sub-object video player, and in the video clip option, put the video you want to play; to make it starts in the game, the only thing needed is a collision with the trigger.
